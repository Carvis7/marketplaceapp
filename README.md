## R7 & R8 - Identify the problem you are trying to solve by building this particular marketplace app. Why is it a problem that needs solving?

Horticulture related hobbies are on the uprise, and people are continually jumping on the bandwagon to own and raise plants due to the many health benefits. These benefits are both mental and physical.

Currently, plants can be purchased through nurseries and home depot stores such as Bunnings, or online through marketplace websites like Gumtree and Ebay.

Instead of having to traverse the listings of an online marketplace that also sells products of various other categories, and having to take a trip downtown to see what the local nursery or hardware store has in stock, I wanted to bring people to a place where there is nothing but the plants they are looking for to fill their home or office space.

I also wanted to reduce waste, as people who are moving can not simply take their plants to a store and trade them in, nor do the local goodwill shops take such items.

The Fancy Plants web app lets people connect and share with each other.
It is a cashed based system where people simple complete their transactions in real life after organising to inspect the plant they have purchased.

This process also allows the user to know exactly what they are paying for, when they are paying for it.

No more plants in the bin when you're moving house, or having to try to force them on unwiling neighbours, and no more scouring other sites looking for something that might not turn out to be what was advertised.

## My Marketplace App

The purpose of my app is to bring together plant enthusiasts and give them a platform to communicate and sell and purchase plants in an environment dedicated to that particular function.

The functionality and features of the app includes [but is not limited to...] :

- **User Accounts**
A user can sign in/sign up, update details, access the marketplace, sell products, buy products, and can converse with other sellers and/or buyers through an inbuilt chat system.
Users are also able to delete their accounts through the update link, if they are unhappy or have decided they have no use for the site.

- **Sign Up**
A user is able to access the marketplace without signing up, but are restricted to a 'look don't touch' basis.
The are unable to do anything but view the listings in the app.
Users can sign up using the form with their email, and can make a password (minimum 6 characters) to associate to that account.

- **Selling**
Users can sell plants of all sorts and are given options to even input the plants 'pot size'. This lets other users know how established the plant is, and whether or not it would be suitable for their home or office.
Once a plant has been purchase by another user, the listing is removed from the main marketplace, and the plant listing is updated in both the 'Sellers' dashboard and the 'Buyers' dashboard to reflect that the product has been purchased.

- **Buying**
Users are able to buy plants from the marketplace, and these plants will then be added to their dashboard. 
The seller will also have the plant moved to a 'sold' area in their user dashboard, and both parties are able to contact each other via the messenger.

- **Listings**
Plant listings contain information about the plant that is up for sale.
Information such as: The name of the plant, the size (pot size in cms), the variant (Whether the plant is a tree, edible, or a bush etc.), and of course, the price of the plant.
The listing also contains a photo, and it is not possible to post a listing that doesn't have an image file attached.
I did this for three reasons:
1. I wanted the user to be able to tell a plant by sight before having to read anything else associated to the listing. I believe this makes for a better user experience.
2. I didn't want a bunch of image-less listings.
3. The buyer is able to somewhat determine what state the plant is in before committing to buy the plant.

- **Messenger**
The inbuilt messaging system allows users to chat with one another about the listings, and organise the payment and handover of the product.
Users, before purchasing, are able to open chat sessions, and ask sellers questions pertaining to the product (plant) they are selling.
